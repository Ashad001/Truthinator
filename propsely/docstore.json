Christopher Kayes\nABSTRACT Qualitative analysis of the events leading to the deaths of eight\nclimbers on Mt Everest in 1996 illustrates the breakdown of learningin teams. The analysis contributes to research on the role of teams\nin organizational disasters by considering team learning and develop-\nment as the basis for success in complex and changing organizations.Multiple qualitative methods reveal three precursors associated withthe breakdown of learning in teams: narrowly de\ufb01ned purpose,directive leadership and failure to sense an ill-de\ufb01ned problem.Findings have implications for normal disasters and sense-making,performance in short-term project teams, and organizationallearning.\nKEYWORDS disaster sense-making /H17039errors and accidents /H17039organizational\nand experiential learning /H17039teams and groups\nThere\u2019s so many things that went wrong \u2013 little errors, things that are\nblack and white down here aren\u2019t really black and white up there.

As organizations increasingly rely on teams to\nrespond to complex organizational problems, research on how teams learnin the face of these challenges takes on heightened importance.\nThis article analyzes the 1996 Mt Everest climbing disaster with regard\nto the breakdown of learning in teams. It follows a growing body of research\nabout the role of learning in organizational errors and their prevention(Edmondson, 1996, 1999; Rasmussen, 1990; Weick & Roberts, 1993).Although it is well understood that team learning contributes to stabilitywhen organizations face complex and challenging situations, this study takesa different direction to argue that the breakdown of team learning can leadto organizational disaster.\nThe analysis is organized as follows. First, I analyze the role of team\nlearning in organizational disaster. Drawing on Mills\u2019s (1967) notion of teamdevelopment, this article describes the importance of learning in teams whenfaced with complex problems emblematic of disaster. Second, multiple quali-tative analysis methods used to interpret the Mt Everest events are described.Third, I recount the events of the 1996 Mt Everest climbing disaster to illus-trate the breakdown of team learning in the face of a complex organizationalproblem. Fourth, analysis of the events reveals factors that impede learning.This analysis integrates theory on adult learning (King & Kitchener, 1994),team development (Mills, 1967) and organizational sense-making (Kiesler &Sproull, 1982). I discuss the implications for learning in short-term projectteams, team leadership and the study of organizational disaster.\nOrganizational disaster\nThere is growing interest in the study of organizational disaster. This research\nis intended to uncover the factors that lead to organizational breakdown andthe mechanisms required to recover. The aim of this research entails: (i)\nuncovering hidden sources of variability in organizational disaster; and (ii)\nidentifying the chain of events that, taken together, constitute the recipe fordisaster. Several interrelated streams of research on disasters exist, eachfocusing on different levels of analysis.\nOne stream has focused on how individuals and teams conceive, delib-\nerate and act upon organizational problems. Janis\u2019s (1972) groupthinkhypothesis, for example, focused on how consensus seeking in policy-makingteams led to a breakdown in critical thinking among team members. Group-\nthink explains how teams forgo valuable deliberation in favor of team\ncohesion. Often, consensus-seeking behaviors characteristic of groupthinktake on a dysfunctional characteristic, leading teams to take action withoutconsideration of multiple options for action or the potential implications ofHuman Relations 57(10) 126402 048355 (to/d)  14/10/04  2:35 pm  Page 1264\n by Sandra Hopps on October 14, 2008 http://hum.sagepub.com Downloaded from", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2905, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d356093-8cef-498a-b575-1ce8b1bd7bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d356093-8cef-498a-b575-1ce8b1bd7bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54c5b045-b9cd-42ad-a296-c370ae4a4638", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "0df65f7afea126751980a25b9a5538a1d73ae648be36d6082e76f8222dc201d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "certain actions. Similarly, Weick (1993) and Weick and Roberts (1993)\nexplored interactions and cognitive sense-making in wild land \ufb01re-\ufb01ghtingand aircraft carriers, respectively, in order to identify how teams respond to\ncrises. Lack of team coordination, confused roles and the failure to respond\nto small setbacks mark just a few factors that ignite disaster and fuel a team\u2019sinability to recover.\nA second stream of research has focused on systemic factors that lead\nto organizational disaster. The systems approach focuses on how minor inci-dents of breakdown during normal operations create a chain reaction leadingto large-scale disaster (Gephart, 1993; Perrow, 1984). Perrow, for example,described how the mechanisms by which a small breakdown escalates intoa larger disaster are related to the degree of interconnectedness or \u2018coupling\u2019\nin the system. For example, in a highly coupled system, one in which systems\nare closely linked, a small incident will quickly create a chain reaction leadingto a larger disaster. By contrast, in a more loosely coupled system, one inwhich systems do not connect closely to each other, a small incident is lesslikely to quickly lead to a greater disaster. Vaughan (1996) identi\ufb01edadditional system-related factors, such as culture, that lead to organizationaldisaster. Vaughan described how deviant culture launches organizationaldisaster by allowing certain kinds of thinking to go unchecked. The under-lying theme of the systems approach lies in the idea that disasters arise fromsystematic breakdowns, from the culture of the organization, or via someother means beyond the discretion and control of individual operators.\nA third and emerging stream of disaster studies has sought to integrate\nmultiple levels of analysis. The integrated approach seeks to provide a more\nrobust, cross-level approach to organizational disaster. This approach looksat how cognitive, systemic and institutional factors work together to createa disaster. For example, Elmes and Barry (1999) focused on how psycho-logical factors, such as individual narcissism, intermingled with structuralchanges in the mountain-climbing industry led to mounting problems in adhoc teams. Along the same lines, Snook (2000) created a multidimensionalanalysis of the accidental shooting-down of a civilian aircraft by the UnitedStates military. The study revealed how, even in highly controlled systems,the engagement of individual, team and organizational-level factors togethercan declare disaster.\nThe study of organizational disasters remains a broad and interdisci-\nplinary program of research directed at understanding the various factorsassociated with preventing, detecting and responding to organizationalbreakdowns. Disaster studies pull from a broad range of traditions, includ-ing psychology, sociology and engineering, and across multiple levels ofanalysis, including individual, team, organization and industry.

Zsambok and Klein (1997), for\nexample, focused on how individuals in teams learn from experience to make\ndecisions in response to shifting environments. Kiesler and Sproull (1982)explained how failure to sense an impending problem may result from limi-tations in individual cognitive capacity. Similarly, Edmondson (1996, 1999)showed that team psychological safety \u2013 the perceived ability to surface anddiscuss errors \u2013 is a key factor in the ability to learn from errors.\nRasmussen (1990) also focused on learning in the context of large-scale\norganizational accidents. Rasmussen viewed the role of human error inorganizational breakdowns as an interaction between two sets of constraints:\n(i) individual access to resources such as knowledge and competence, access\nto information, and the ability to process data; and (ii) task constraints suchas degree of discretion over the task, the various strategies available formaking choices, and control over the path taken to achieve goals.\nThis article proposes to enhance our understanding of organizational\ndisasters by looking at the breakdown of learning in teams. First, this article\ufb01lls a gap in understanding the processes related to the breakdown oflearning. Although research has identi\ufb01ed the processes that enhance learningin teams, little research has focused on learning breakdowns. This is import-ant because the factors that lead to breakdown are often different from thosethat lead to learning (Mohr, 1982). Second, the article illustrates Mills\u2019s(1967) proposition that teams engaged in complex tasks require learning.\nFor Mills, team learning is not tangential to team performance. Teamlearning lay at the heart of effective teams, particularly when a team faced asituation with a wide range of contingencies and multiple potentialresponses. When learning breaks down, teams fail to function. As knowledgework, short-term project teams and task forces become core strategy foraccomplishing goals in organizations, Mills compels us to see the signi\ufb01canceof learning in teams as central to organizational success. A qualitativeanalysis of the 1996 Mt Everest disaster serves as the basis to explorelearning in teams.Human Relations 57(10) 126602 048355 (to/d)  14/10/04  2:35 pm  Page 1266\n by Sandra Hopps on October 14, 2008 http://hum.sagepub.com Downloaded from", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe54ba3a-5132-48f2-b594-3b4e3358ebad": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe54ba3a-5132-48f2-b594-3b4e3358ebad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "faaada80-88ed-4b21-beb7-ea6b5ae4fa3d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "750641e63ae7e63cdd0d7554a106f67741911e8d470c2001bf138f3c4c1430ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Methods\nThe 1996 Mt Everest climbing disaster served as the data for this exploration\nof the nature of learning and its breakdown. The year 1996 stands as thedeadliest year in the 43-year history of climbing Mt Everest, with a total of\n15 climber deaths and several other serious injuries. This analysis focuses on\nthree expedition teams and the death of eight climbers as a dramatic exampleof organizational disaster.\nData collection\nData consisted of more than 1750 pages of information drawn from multiple\npublic sources, including photographs, charts, Internet \ufb01lings by expeditionteams, published \ufb01rst-hand accounts of survivors and observers, popular\npress reports, videotaped interviews by reporters, and the personal experi-\nence of the principal investigator. With the exception of personal experience,all data were obtained from public sources. Data collection began in May1996, immediately following the disaster, and has continued until the \ufb01nalpreparation of this manuscript. I obtained accounts from as many partici-pants as possible. Post hoc data came from the Internet in the form of down-loaded daily reports \ufb01led by climbing teams via satellite directly from theircampsites prior to the May 10 summit attempt. Additional documents wereobtained and reviewed by following the public debate that ensued in the\naftermath of the events. Following the events, numerous documents were\nproduced by survivors who participated in public forums, press reports, talk-show interviews, Internet chat rooms, lectures and documentaries.\nAnalytic strategy\nThe events of 1996 pose unique research challenges because, unlike other\ndisaster sense-making, there were no publicly authorized investigations, nohearings or inquiries conducted by authoritative bodies, no systematic assem-\nblage of archival records and little trace data (Gephart, 1993; Weick, 1993).\nAs is common with sense-making strategies, I combined multiple analyticstrategies of analysis.\nFirst, a timeline of likely events was created after an extensive review\nof public accounts of survivors and observers. Reliability for the timeline wasenhanced when a set of researchers, working completely independently ofthis principal investigator, published a similar timeline of events in a peer-reviewed journal (Elmes & Barry, 1999).

Experience is\nrecognized as an important element in sense-making research (e.g. Weick,1993). Similar to ethnographic approaches to disaster sense-making, experi-ence informs the analysis as the investigator becomes immersed in the cultureunder investigation (Gephart, 1993). Investigator involvement is consistentwith action-learning approaches (Reason & Bradbury, 2001) to organiz-ational research, even though the principal investigator was never directlyinvolved in the events \u2013 only in the culture.\nThe combination of strategies helped to achieve medium accuracy,\nmedium generality and low simplicity in the trade-offs inherent in qualitativeresearch (Langley, 1999).

The American(US) team consisted of 12 members, including Scott Fischer, the expedition\nleader, as well as assistants Neal Beidleman and Anatoli Boukreev. Each team\nwent through nearly 6 weeks of acclimatizing and preparation, and eachreached the highest camp (Camp IV) on May 9.\nExpedition leaders knew that the best time to attempt the climb to the\nsummit was in the early morning. Accordingly, the NZ team left Camp IVat 11.35 p.m., followed by the US team at 12 a.m. Earlier in the week, manyof the leaders of the 30 expeditions seeking the summit had met to deter-mine the order in which each team would begin the \ufb01nal summit. The ex-peditions led by Hall and Fischer were to be the only teams leaving for the\nsummit from the highest camp, Camp IV, on May 10. The Taiwanese ex-\npedition leader broke this apparent agreement and set out from Camp IVbetween 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. with Sherpa guides (Krakauer, 1997a).\nIn his personal account of the events, climber Jon Krakauer (1997a)\nexplained that during the \ufb01nal 18-hour push to the summit, \u2018survival is tono small degree, a race against the clock\u2019 (p. 173). Ideally, if climbers begintheir summit attempt at 12 a.m., they should reach the summit between 12and 1 p.m. and head down soon after. Climbing teams typically establishturnaround times that represent chronological reminders for when toabandon efforts for the summit and begin descent. Past Everest expeditionshad set turnaround times ranging from a conservative 12 noon to a risky2p.m. Most team members were also equipped with individual support tech-\nnology, such as supplementary bottled oxygen and emergency steroids to\nprovide energy in case of severe exhaustion. The team members were not,however, equipped with radios to communicate either within or betweenteams.\nAt about 5.30 a.m., three members of the American team reached the\nbeginning of a long narrow ridge running between 27,200 and 28,000 ftknown as the Southeast Ridge Balcony. Krakauer (1997a), who was amember of the NZ team, reported seeing three US team members on the ridgeand assistant guide Sherpa Lapsong Jangbu pulling another climber behindhim. Here the teams were forced to stop because \ufb01xed safety ropes had notbeen secured beyond that point. The NZ, US and Taiwanese teams inter-mingled as the teams worked together to secure the safety ropes that wouldimprove the safety of the next leg of the climb.

First, these events \ufb01t Perrow\u2019s (1984) de\ufb01nition ofa disaster \u2018incident\u2019, because the events led to the breakdown of speci\ufb01c units\nof an organization. The consequences of the Mt Everest event were con\ufb01ned\nto a few units (teams) and created no ongoing disruption to climbing on MtEverest or mountain climbing in general.\nSecond, the events meet the three criteria for a critical event worthy of\nresearch (March et al., 1991). The disaster: (i) served as a branching point forthe historical development of the mountain-climbing industry, as it transi-tioned from an informal network of climbers to a commercialized industry(Elmes & Barry, 1999); (ii) contradicted a belief, widely held at the time ofthe disaster, that climbing Mt Everest had become routine and required no\nspecial expertise in climbing; and (iii) evoked strong metaphorical power as\ndemonstrated through the multiple accounts of the events in the popular press.\nThe third reason to study the Everest events is that mountain climbing\nserves as a symbolic representation of complex social process (Mitchell,1983), and the speci\ufb01c events of 1996 served as the topic of several best-selling books and movies and countless press features. Thus, the eventsachieved a symbolic importance beyond the local climbing community.

Exhibition\nteams climbing Mt Everest represent a team whose primary purpose lies inwhat Mills called a \u2018fourth-order\u2019 purpose: effectively, the ability of a teamwhose purpose is learning. According to Mills, a fourth-order purpose requiresteams to establish \u2018enough freedom from external restraints, obligations, andcommitments, and suf\ufb01cient emancipation from past routine, habit, andtradition\u2019 (p. 102) to respond to complexity and contingency. When learningbreaks down in the face of a fourth-order purpose, not only does a team failto learn, but it may fail to survive. Just such a scenario existed on Everest.\nThis article extends knowledge about organizational disasters by\nexamining the process nature of team learning. The study draws on Mills\u2019s(1967) proposition that when a team is confronted with a complex and chal-\nlenging task, learning lies at the heart of team success. Mills viewed teamlearning as a \u2018combination of reciprocity to new information and readinessto revise past assessments of a situation\u2019 (p. 98).

The events reveal that the consequences ofstrong leadership lie in limiting the discretion of team members in theirability to respond to changing circumstances.

An ill-de\ufb01ned problem arises when\nthe solution to the problem cannot be answered with current knowledge.Three criteria establish an ill-de\ufb01ned problem: (i) the goal to be achieved isunclear, (ii) the solution to achieve the goal is unclear, and (iii) experts willdisagree on whether the goal has been achieved (King & Kitchener, 1994).Examples showing that many of the teams believed they faced a well-de\ufb01nedproblem can be found in pre-summit statements (e.g. \u2018as long as the weatherholds we will have success\u2019, \u2018we\u2019ve got the Big E [Everest] all \ufb01gured out\u2019,\u2018all indications point towards a successful climb\u2019) and the reliance on a priorKayes Learning in teams 127702 048355 (to/d)  14/10/04  2:35 pm  Page 1277\n by Sandra Hopps on October 14, 2008 http://hum.sagepub.com Downloaded from", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2782, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "039e66c4-9781-4569-9b28-68ff00bd5675": {"__data__": {"id_": "039e66c4-9781-4569-9b28-68ff00bd5675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e184d2c6-61ac-46bd-ab9c-cef33e0afcf0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\SeventhSem\\AssignmentEvaluator\\data\\The_1996_Mount_Everest_climbing_disaster_The_break.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 264108, "creation_date": "2024-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "bdb1b43e06c8bf378a25f9f5d86772e46086c883c84a253dc44f6995d3a6f015", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2018100% success rate\u2019 in the face of mounting complexity. Importantly, the\nteams, for a variety of reasons, failed to sense the problem as ill-de\ufb01ned. (Fora discussion of why an individual might fail to sense a problem, see Kiesler\n& Sproull, 1982.)\nOrganizing processes\nTo facilitate the testability, thoroughness and ultimate usefulness of the\nproposed theory for explaining the organizational breakdown, several tests\nwere conducted (Mohr, 1982). First, each precursor was conceived as adichotomous phase or event, not a continuous variable. Second, the incident(i.e. organizational breakdown) occurred when all three precursors merged.That is, no single element is inherently problematic on its own or whencombined with any other single element. Each element alone is necessary butnot suf\ufb01cient for the the outcome. The combination of a narrowly de\ufb01nedpurpose, directive leadership and the failure to sense an ill-de\ufb01ned problemprovides the ingredients for organizational breakdown. For example, threepossible combinations of precursors can arise that do not spell disaster:\n1 The combination of a narrowly de\ufb01ned goal and directive leadership\nmay be necessary for achieving certain aspects of a goal. This combi-nation may account for Hall\u2019s \u2018100% success rate,\u2019 because narrowgoals and directive leadership are expected to facilitate the achievementof goals (Locke & Latham, 1990).\n2 The combination of narrowly de\ufb01ned purpose and ill-de\ufb01ned problem\noften results in enhanced learning, as individuals exercise discretionover changing circumstances (Rasmussen, 1990). The combination ofill-de\ufb01ned problem and narrowly de\ufb01ned purpose may have improvedperformance in earlier expeditions to Mt Everest, when individualswere responsible for exercising considerable discretion in response tochanging circumstances (Elmes & Barry, 1999).\n3 The combination of directive leadership and ill-de\ufb01ned problem canallow for necessary adaptation when discretion is built into the system.For example, in Viestur\u2019s characterization of the purpose of mountainclimbing \u2013 \u2018getting to the top is optional, getting down is not\u2019 \u2013 heinherently refers to being adaptive in the face of unknown contingen-cies characteristic of an ill-de\ufb01ned problem. Directive leadership islikely to provide a common focus and standardize procedures, neces-sary for organizing during changing circumstances.\nAnother test ensured the process nature of the theory by identifying a\nsequence of events.

The Everest events provide the basis for a process theory ofteam breakdown and reveal key variables that led to this breakdown. By\nsuggesting a recipe for why team learning fails, the study provides the basis\nto better understand the limits of how organizations learn and respond tochanging environments. The study provides insight into learning in short-term project teams, common organizational disaster and the relationshipbetween learning and leadership.\nThis article contributes to understanding the importance of team-level\nlearning and its impact on organizational learning (Edmondson, 2002) byfocusing on the process (rather than variance) factors associated with thebreakdown of team learning. An interesting area for future research lies in\nthe link between face-saving behaviors, such as psychological safety\n(Edmondson, 2002) and its application to organizational disaster. The studyhas particular signi\ufb01cance for learning in short-term project teams that typi-cally form and dissolve after one time events. Because project teams oftenlack the time and resources to progress through a developmental sequencenecessary for higher levels of learning (Gersick, 1988), performance may takeprecedence over learning (see Kayes, 2003). In the face of an environmentthat requires learning, short-term project teams may encounter the limits ofthe positive effects of goal-setting (e.g. Locke & Latham, 1990).\nThe Everest events shed light onto the dynamics that occur as organiz-\nations move within the coupling\u2013interaction grid (Perrow, 1984).

For example, Elmes and Carlile (2002) describe how the changingnature of the mountain-climbing industry may have contributed to this\ndisaster. An application of Perrow\u2019s Normal Accident hypothesis suggests\nthat the mountain-climbing industry has moved from a loosely coupled andinteractive organization to a complex and intermediate-coupled organiz-ation. This move marks a shift from a single- to a multiple-goal organizationand requires that organizations rely on a different type of knowledge. Amultiple-goal organization cannot rely on spurious knowledge of elites (suchas expedition leaders) and tradition (such as the mountain-climbing folklore)but must devise multiple agendas with alternative pathways (Perrow, 1984).The same logic holds for teams. Teams that function with multiple goals\nrequire greater learning in order to adapt to changing organizational circum-\nstances.\nOne surprise of this study came in the close relationship between\nlearning and leadership; it shows how leadership gets in the way of teamlearning. Consistent with Elmes and Barry (1999), the present analysis of theEverest disaster describes how leaders often inhibit rather than enhance teamperformance. This study, however, moves beyond the narcissistic leader tosuggest a different metaphor. The narcissistic leader is driven by the need toprove personal worth and in the process drags the team along. Leader asNarcissus is a story of self-indulgence. The story of Mt Everest is one of howthe temptation of goal achievement overtakes the leader\u2019s ability to consideralternative courses of action. Narcissus focuses on individual limitations; the\nEverest story focuses on the temptations established by clearly de\ufb01ned goalsand the rewards that \ufb02ow from achieving them.\nThis study attempted to create a general theory based on a single case\nstudy, accordingly, only medium accuracy and generality were achieved,while the complexity of the study remains high. Although the events createvivid details of the breakdown of learning, the theory requires further veri\ufb01-cation, elaboration and measures for testing. Also, by creating a narrative,some details of the events were highlighted, whereas others were deemed lessimportant, thus, although the study accurately depicts known details of theevents, the presentation is necessarily selective. Based on the limitation ofusing a single case, the study is best generalized to short-term project teamsinvolved in complex and changing tasks.\nThis study suggests two speci\ufb01c areas for future research. Continued\nrational pursuit of goals can easily become unproductive and lead to organiz-ational breakdowns when the goals are narrowly structured, learning isrestricted and the problem faced is complex.
