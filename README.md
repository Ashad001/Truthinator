# LLM Response Assessor & Generator

So you gave GPT your assignment PDF, and now you’re stuck wondering if its response is actually any good? Well, congrats! This project is here to do the dirty work: assess the AI’s half-baked response, tell you how wrong it is, then *try* to fix it for you. Because, clearly, you have better things to do.

## Features

1. **Automated Accuracy Check**: Because manually verifying LLM responses is so 2022.
2. **Response Generation**: The AI will give a new response if the first one sucked. (Spoiler: it probably did.)
3. **Repeat Until "Perfect"**: We’ll keep going until the AI gets it right, or you give up.

## How It Works

- Load your PDF into a vector database.
- Paste the LLM’s response.
- We’ll score it (1-10), then rewrite it if needed. Rinse and repeat.

## Setup

1. Clone:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashad001/LLM-response-assessor.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your `.env` file:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
